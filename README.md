This was my senior project at DeVry University Crystal City campus class of 2009. This project used sensors on a custom built robot car running on an Atmel 168 Microcontroller with only 1k of RAM and limited support for C++. The robot car used sonar sensors to avoid collisions and used dead reckoning and AI path finding to navigate through a preprogrammed map.
